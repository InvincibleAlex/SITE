                       <p> Drifting</b> is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction, while maintaining control and driving the car through the 
                        entirety of a corner. The technique causes the rear slip angle to exceed the front slip angle to such an extent that often the front wheels are pointing in
                         the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as opposite lock or counter-steering). 
                        Drifting is traditionally done by <b>clutch kicking</b>, then intentionally oversteering and countersteering.
